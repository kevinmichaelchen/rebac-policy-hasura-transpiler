# Architecture

Transpilation works in a few phases:

1. We parse external policies (e.g., written in Rego) and transforms them into an internal structure.
1. We convert that internal structure into a GraphQL AST.
1. We convert that GraphQL AST into JSON for Hasura Permissions Rules.
1. (Future) We sync the JSON into your Hasura metadata.

## Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) ðŸŒ²

We rely heavily on several libraries to do the heavy lifting around ASTs:

- [GoDoc â€” OPA AST][godoc-opa-ast]
- [GoDoc â€” GraphQL AST][godoc-graphql-ast]

## Example
